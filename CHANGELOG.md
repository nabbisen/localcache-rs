## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.19.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added — RFC 0007: Read-only Connection Pool (`ReadPool<T>`)

- New `ReadPool<T>` type in `src/read_pool.rs` — a cloneable, `Clone + Send + Sync`
  pool of N independent read-only [`CacheEngine`] connections.
- Checkout strategy: round-robin start, `try_lock` scan across all slots,
  blocking fallback on the start slot — no lock-ordering deadlock.
- **Read-side API only** (write methods are absent from the type):
  `get`, `get_if_fresh`, `batch_get`, `batch_get_fresh`, `check_status`,
  `check_status_batch`, `contains`, `explain`, `keys`, `list_entries`,
  `entry_count`, `cache_stats`, `export_entries`, `scan_dir`,
  `scan_dir_filtered`, `query_run`, `query_dry_run`, `size`.
- `CacheEngineBuilder::build_read_pool(size)` — fluent pool construction.
- Two connection backends controlled by `CacheOptions::shared_cache`:
  - **independent** (default) — each slot opens with plain `read_only` flags;
    fully independent page caches; maximum WAL read parallelism.
  - **shared-cache** — RFC 0004 mode; shared page cache across slots;
    lower memory on large pools.
- `:memory:` databases and `size == 0` are rejected at construction with a
  clear `UnsupportedFeature` error.
- `ReadPool` re-exported from `localcache::ReadPool`.

### Added — RFC 0008: Compatibility Guarantees

- **Wire-format stability guarantee** formally documented and test-enforced:
  - Documented in `Codec::Bincode` doc comment, `src/serialization.rs`
    module doc, and a new section in `docs/src/migration.md`.
  - Golden fixture database committed: `tests/fixtures/compat-v0_18.sqlite3`
    (written by v0.18.0, Delete journal mode, < 32 KiB).
  - `tests/compat.rs` opens the fixture on every CI run and asserts
    bit-exact payload decodes (`compat_plain_bincode_*`,
    `compat_compressed_*`, `compat_plain_and_compressed_coexist_in_same_db`).
  - `examples/gen_compat_fixture.rs` — the committed, auditable one-off
    generator; marked **do not run routinely**.
- **Path semantics** documented and tested:
  - New "Path handling" section in `docs/src/api.md`: canonicalization
    contract, deleted-file raw-path fallback, `cleanup_missing_files`
    semantics, Windows case-insensitivity behaviour.
  - `src/path.rs` module doc extended with the full path-handling contract.
  - `cleanup_missing_files` doc comment added with case-insensitive
    filesystem note.
  - New regression tests: `path_relative_and_absolute_resolve_to_same_entry`,
    `deleted_file_entry_reachable_by_raw_path_fallback`,
    `cleanup_missing_files_removes_exactly_absent_entries`,
    `cleanup_missing_files_leaves_all_present_entries_intact`,
    `symlink_resolves_to_target_entry` (`#[cfg(unix)]`).

### Changed

- **Release tarball structure** changed from `localcache/(files)` to
  `localcache-vX.Y.Z/(files)`:
  - Archive name now uses a `v` prefix: `localcache-v0.19.0.tar.gz`.
  - Extracted top-level directory matches the archive version:
    `localcache-v0.19.0/`.
- RFC 0007 and RFC 0008 moved from `rfcs/proposed/` to `rfcs/done/`,
  Status updated to `Implemented (v0.19.0)`.

---

## [0.18.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added — RFC 0006: Directory-scoped Query Predicates

- `QueryBuilder::path_in_dir(dir, recursive: bool)` — exact directory
  scoping in SQL:
  - `recursive = false`: matches only **direct children** of `dir`
    (`LIKE 'dir/%' AND NOT LIKE 'dir/%/%'`).
  - `recursive = true`: matches the **entire subtree**
    (`LIKE 'dir/%'`).
  - `dir` is canonicalized when it exists on disk; falls back to the raw
    path string otherwise, so queries over deleted directories still match
    their stored entries.
  - LIKE metacharacters (`\`, `%`, `_`) inside directory names are escaped
    automatically — they always match literally.
- `QueryBuilder::path_glob(pattern)` — glob matching in SQL using the same
  dialect as `ScanOptions::glob_pattern`:
  - `*` — any sequence of characters (SQLite `GLOB *`)
  - `?` — exactly one character (SQLite `GLOB ?`)
  - `{a,b,c}` — brace alternation expanded to `OR`-chained `GLOB` terms
  - `[` in a pattern matches a literal `[`; character classes are
    intentionally unsupported.
- Both predicates AND-combine with `path_like`, `index_hint`, payload
  predicates (json feature), and each other.
- Both predicates are reflected in `dry_run()` / `query_dry_run()` EXPLAIN
  QUERY PLAN output.

### Changed

- `repository::keys()` and `repository::explain_query()` refactored to use a
  shared `build_path_sql()` helper and `rusqlite::params_from_iter` for
  variable-length parameter binding — replaces the two-case fixed-count match.
- `engine::expand_braces` and `split_top_level` promoted from private to
  `pub(crate)` (used by `QueryBuilder::path_glob`).
- `escape_like()` added to `repository.rs` (private) — escapes LIKE
  metacharacters for the `path_in_dir` prefix construction.
- RFC 0006 status in `rfcs/proposed/` updated to `Implemented (v0.18.0)`
  and moved to `rfcs/done/`.

---

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added — RFC 0001: Recursive Directory Watching (`watching` feature)

- `CacheWatcher::watch_dir(dir)` / `unwatch_dir(dir)` — register an
  entire directory subtree for recursive watching with a single OS watch.
- `CacheDebouncedWatcher::watch_dir(dir)` / `unwatch_dir(dir)` — same
  for the debounced variant.
- `CacheEngineBuilder::watch_dirs(bool)` — opt-in builder flag; when
  `true`, `watcher()` / `debounced_watcher()` auto-register each cached
  path's **parent directory** recursively instead of one OS watch per file.
- Both watcher callbacks now apply a `contains()` membership filter before
  emitting events, ensuring uncached files in watched subtrees are silently
  ignored.
- `CacheOptions::watch_dirs: bool` field (default `false`).

### Added — RFC 0002: Query Index Hints and Explain Plan

- `QueryBuilder::index_hint(name)` — injects `INDEXED BY <name>` into
  the path-listing SQL; returns `Err(Database(_))` on an invalid name.
- `QueryBuilder::dry_run()` → `Result<String>` — runs
  `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` on the query SQL and returns the plan; no payloads
  are loaded.
- `AsyncCacheEngine::query_dry_run(|q| …)` — async wrapper for
  `dry_run()`.
- `repository::explain_query()` internal function.

### Added — RFC 0003: OpenTelemetry Spans

- New `opentelemetry` Cargo feature (`["tracing", "dep:opentelemetry",
  "dep:tracing-opentelemetry"]`).  Pulls in compatible
  `opentelemetry 0.32` + `tracing-opentelemetry 0.33` so callers can
  install `OpenTelemetryLayer` without a version mismatch.  No span sites
  are added; the library emits zero OTel API calls itself.
- **`namespace` field** added to all three existing `tracing` spans
  (`localcache::get`, `localcache::set`, `localcache::check_status`).
  Gated only on `#[cfg(feature = "tracing")]` — improves plain tracing
  output too.
- `check_status` upgraded from inline `debug!` events to a proper
  `debug_span!`, consistent with `get` and `set`.

### Added — RFC 0004: Read-only Shared-cache Mode

- `CacheOptions::shared_cache: bool` field (default `false`).
- `CacheEngineBuilder::shared_cache()` builder method.
- When enabled on a **file-backed** database, opens via SQLite `file:` URI
  (`mode=ro&cache=shared`) with `PRAGMA query_only = ON`; implies
  `read_only = true`.
- When enabled on **`:memory:`**, opens `file::memory:?cache=shared` in
  read-write mode — multiple engines in the same process share the named
  in-memory database (useful for testing and in-process pipelines).
- `uri_encode_path()` internal helper (escapes `%`, `#`, `?`, space in
  SQLite URI path components; no extra dependency).

### Added — RFC 0005: async-std / smol Feature Variants

- New `async-std` Cargo feature — enables `AsyncCacheEngine` backed by
  `async_std::task::spawn_blocking` (async-std 1.13).
- New `smol` Cargo feature — enables `AsyncCacheEngine` backed by
  `smol::unblock` (smol 2.x).
- New `src/cache/runtime.rs` — `SpawnBlocking` trait with
  `TokioRuntime`, `AsyncStdRuntime`, and `SmolRuntime` impls; public
  `spawn_blocking` dispatch function.
- When multiple runtime features are enabled, priority order is
  **Tokio (`async`) > async-std > smol** — features remain additive,
  keeping `--all-features` and docs.rs working.
- `AsyncTaskPanicked` error variant now covers all three runtime features.
- `AsyncCacheEngine` and `runtime` module gating extended from
  `#[cfg(feature = "async")]` to
  `#[cfg(any(feature = "async", feature = "async-std", feature = "smol"))]`.

### Changed

- **RFC folder structure** — adopted the RFC 000 lifecycle policy.
  All five RFCs moved from the flat `rfcs/` root to `rfcs/done/`; Status
  fields updated to `Implemented (v0.17.0)`.  `rfcs/proposed/` and
  `rfcs/archive/` folders created.  `rfcs/README.md` rewritten as a
  proper lifecycle index.
- `rfcs/done/000-rfc-lifecycle-policy.md` added (self-applying: the
  policy document lives in `done/` because it is implemented).
- **CI matrix** extended with `watching`, `metrics`, `async-std`, `smol`,
  and `opentelemetry` feature combinations.
- **`[[example]]` targets** declared with `required-features` to prevent
  build failures when optional features are absent:
  - `document_pipeline` requires `json,compression`
  - `embedding_cache` requires `json`
  - `connection_pool` requires `async`
- Pre-existing unused-import warnings in `tests/query.rs` and
  `tests/portability.rs` suppressed with `#[allow(unused_imports)]`.

### Fixed

- `repository::keys()` and `repository::explain_query()` — replaced
  `if pattern.is_some() { … pattern.unwrap() … }` with `if let Some(pat)`
  (clippy `clippy::unwrap_used` → clean).
- Redundant raw-pointer cast in `async_engine::query_dry_run` removed
  (clippy `unnecessary_cast` → clean).

---

## [0.16.2] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- **`rfcs/` directory** — implementation-ready design specifications for
  planned features, written in English to match the rest of `docs/`.

  | RFC | Title | Template |
  |-----|-------|----------|
  | [0001](rfcs/0001-recursive-directory-watching.md) | Recursive Directory Watching | Lightweight |
  | [0002](rfcs/0002-query-index-hints.md) | Query Index Hints and Explain Plan | Full |
  | [0003](rfcs/0003-opentelemetry-spans.md) | OpenTelemetry Spans | Full |
  | [0004](rfcs/0004-shared-memory-db.md) | Read-only Shared-memory DB Mode | Full |
  | [0005](rfcs/0005-async-std-smol.md) | async-std / smol Feature Variants | Full |

  Each RFC covers: summary, motivation, public API surface, internal
  design with code sketches, test plan, and (where applicable) security
  considerations and open questions.

---

## [0.16.1] — 2026-05-04

### Changed

- `src/tests.rs` (4 722 lines) split into 8 thematic integration-test files
  under `tests/` alongside `tests/common/mod.rs` for shared helpers.
  Each file is an independent test binary; individual suites can be run with
  e.g. `cargo test --test core`.

  | File | Theme | Tests |
  |---|---|---|
  | `tests/core.rs` | Basic ops, namespaces, TTL | 26 |
  | `tests/storage.rs` | Hashing, scan, schema migration | 30 |
  | `tests/codec_lru.rs` | JSON codec, LRU, glob, encryption | 31 |
  | `tests/builder_ops.rs` | Builder, stats, brace expansion, on_evict | 24 |
  | `tests/portability.rs` | Export / import | 8 |
  | `tests/query.rs` | QueryBuilder, ordering, touch, indexes | 30 |
  | `tests/pool_observe.rs` | ConnectionPool, explain, tracing | 20 |
  | `tests/watching.rs` | Preload, watcher, debounce, metrics, namespace | 19 |

  Total: **188** integration tests + **15** doc-tests (unchanged).

- Two `pub(crate)` internal references removed from the old `src/tests.rs`
  before moving to `tests/` (required for top-level test binaries):
  * `crate::detection::hash::PARTIAL_PREFIX` → literal `"partial:"`
  * `crate::serialization::serialize_bincode` →
    `bincode::serde::encode_to_vec(..., bincode::config::legacy())`

- Unused-import warnings eliminated across all source files and new test
  files; all feature combinations are now warning-free.

---

## [0.16.0] — 2026-05-04

### Changed

- **Documentation overhaul** — the `docs/` mdBook has been completely
  rewritten to reflect the v0.15 API.  All chapters now contain working
  code examples, accurate type names, and feature-flag annotations.

  New chapters added:
  * **Features** — per-feature guide with code examples for all 7 flags.
  * **Builder API** — every `CacheEngineBuilder` method documented.
  * **Async & Thread Safety** — `AsyncCacheEngine`, `ConnectionPool`,
    `shared_engine`, SQLite concurrency model, and a decision table.
  * **Querying the Cache** — `QueryBuilder` predicates, multi-column sort,
    pagination, `explain()`, and namespace management.
  * **File Watching** — `CacheWatcher`, `CacheDebouncedWatcher`, the
    watcher lifetime contract, platform table, and a thread-ownership pattern.
  * **Data Portability** — export/import, `import_from`, `preload()`,
    and glob pattern reference.
  * **Cookbook** — 7 complete recipes: embedding pipeline, multi-threaded
    web server, reactive pipeline, versioned cache, encrypted cache,
    TTL-based expiry, metrics with Prometheus.
  * **CLI Tool** — all 17 subcommands with flags and output examples.
  * **Migration Guide** — bincode 1→2 upgrade, `payload_version` bump,
    DB migration, builder migration, schema version history.
  * **Changelog Summary** — phase-by-phase history from 0.1 to 0.15.

  Updated chapters:
  * **Introduction** — feature comparison table, quick links.
  * **Getting Started** — updated to use builder API, added `preload`.
  * **Change Detection** — all 4 modes, decision table, `explain()` usage.
  * **Architecture** — schema v4, encoding tags, write/read path diagrams.
  * **Error Handling** — full variant table including all feature-gated errors.
  * **API Overview** — complete type catalogue for v0.15.
  * **Roadmap** — completed phases table.

- `docs/book.toml` — repository URL updated to
  `https://github.com/nabbisen/localcache-rs`; search and fold enabled.
- `docs/src/SUMMARY.md` — restructured into **User Guide** / **Reference** /
  **Development** sections.

---

## [0.15.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added

- **`metrics` Cargo feature** — opt-in instrumentation using
  [`metrics 0.24`](https://crates.io/crates/metrics).  When enabled,
  the following counters and histograms are emitted (all labelled
  `namespace = <current namespace>`):
  * `localcache.get.total` — every `get()` call.
  * `localcache.get.hit` — cache hits in `get()`.
  * `localcache.get.miss` — cache misses in `get()`.
  * `localcache.set.total` — every `set()` call.
  * `localcache.set.bytes` — payload size in bytes per `set()`.
  Wire up any `metrics`-compatible exporter (Prometheus, StatsD, …) to
  consume these metrics without changing the `localcache` API.
- **`CacheEngine::namespace_list()`** — returns all distinct namespace
  names present in the current database, sorted alphabetically.
- **`CacheEngine::namespace_copy(source)`** — copy all entries from
  `source` (any `CacheEngine<U>`) into the current engine's namespace,
  replacing conflicts.  Equivalent to `import_from` with a more
  discoverable name for namespace-management workflows.
- **`CacheEngine::debounced_watcher(window)`** → `CacheDebouncedWatcher<T>`
  — a debounced variant of the file-system watcher (requires `watching`
  feature).  All OS events within `window` of each other for the same path
  are collapsed into a single `WatchEvent`, preventing floods caused by
  editors that write files incrementally or applications that flush many
  times per second.
- **`CacheDebouncedWatcher<T>`** — new public type (re-exported under
  `watching` feature).  Has the same `events() -> &Receiver<WatchEvent>`
  lifetime contract as `CacheWatcher`.
- **`notify-debouncer-mini 0.7`** added as an optional dependency (included
  by the `watching` feature alongside `notify 8`).
- **CLI `namespaces` subcommand** — prints a table of all namespaces in the
  database together with their entry counts.
- **`Makefile.toml`** — `cargo-make` task definitions for the full
  development and publish workflow:
  * `cargo make check` — format check + clippy (default, all features,
    no features).
  * `cargo make test-all` — test matrix (no features / default / all
    features).
  * `cargo make pre-publish` — all quality gates before releasing.
  * `cargo make release-check` — version consistency + changelog entry +
    all quality gates.
  * `cargo make publish-all` — publish library then CLI with a 30-second
    propagation delay.

---

## [0.14.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added

- **`watching` Cargo feature** — background file-system watcher using
  [`notify 8`](https://crates.io/crates/notify) (OS-native: `inotify` on
  Linux, `kqueue` on macOS, `ReadDirectoryChanges` on Windows).  Zero
  additional cost when the feature is disabled.
- **`CacheWatcher<T>`** — a background watcher tied to a `CacheEngine`.
  - Created via `CacheEngine::watcher()`.
  - Automatically registers all cached paths at construction time using a
    dedicated SQLite connection for the callback thread.
  - When a watched file is modified, renamed, or deleted, the corresponding
    cache entry is removed from the database and a `WatchEvent` is sent on
    an internal `mpsc::sync_channel`.
  - `watch(path)` / `unwatch(path)` — add/remove paths at runtime.
  - `events()` — borrow the `mpsc::Receiver<WatchEvent>` (watcher must stay
    alive while reading).
  - `watched_count()` — number of entries in the watcher's engine snapshot.
  - **Lifetime note**: dropping `CacheWatcher` stops the OS watcher and
    closes the channel.  Use `events()` (which borrows) rather than
    `into_receiver()` to keep the watcher alive.
- **`WatchEvent { path, reason }`** — new public type.
- **`InvalidationReason`** enum — `FileModified` | `FileRemoved` |
  `FileRenamed`.
- **`CacheEngine::preload(dir, opts, force, factory)`** — bulk-cache all
  files in a directory using a user-supplied `factory` closure:
  * `force = false` — skips entries that are already fresh (cheap check
    before calling `factory`).
  * `force = true` — recomputes every file unconditionally.
  * Returns a `PreloadReport`.
- **`PreloadReport { stored, already_fresh, skipped, errors }`** — new
  public type summarising the preload outcome; per-file error strings for
  skipped files.
- **CLI `watch` subcommand** — prints live invalidation events in the format
  `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] MODIFIED /path/to/file`.  Press Ctrl-C to stop.
  Gracefully exits with an error message when the `watching` feature is not
  compiled in.
- **`watching` feature in `localcache-cli`** — opt-in:
  `cargo build -p localcache-cli --features watching`.

### Dependencies

- `notify = "8"` added as optional dependency (`watching` feature).

---

## [0.13.2] — 2026-05-03

### Changed

- **`bincode` upgraded from 1.3.3 to 2.0.1** with `features = ["serde"]`.
  - `bincode 3.0.0` on crates.io is an intentional stub (see [xkcd #2347](https://xkcd.com/2347/))
    and not a real release; `2.0.1` is the actual latest stable version.
  - All encode/decode calls migrated to `bincode::serde::encode_to_vec` /
    `bincode::serde::decode_from_slice` with `bincode::config::legacy()`.
  - **Wire format is backward-compatible**: `config::legacy()` produces
    byte-for-byte identical output to bincode 1.x, so existing SQLite caches
    require no migration.
  - `LocalFileCacheError::Serialization` inner type changed from
    `Box<bincode::ErrorKind>` to `String` (the bincode 2.x error types are
    not the same as 1.x; `String` avoids exposing an upstream implementation
    detail in the public API).

---

## [0.13.1] — 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Updated repository URL to <https://github.com/nabbisen/localcache-rs> across
  all manifests and documentation.
- `rusqlite` dependency bumped from 0.32 to **0.39** (no API changes to the
  localcache public interface).
- `criterion` dev-dependency bumped from 0.5 to **0.8**; migrated
  `criterion::black_box` → `std::hint::black_box` as required by the new version.
- `base64` bumped from 0.22.0 to **0.22.1** (patch).
- Workspace-level package metadata (`[workspace.package]`) introduced: `version`,
  `edition`, `rust-version`, `authors`, `license`, `repository` are now declared
  once in the root `Cargo.toml` and inherited by `localcache-cli`.
- `criterion::black_box` replaced with `std::hint::black_box` in bench suite.
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `.github/` refreshed.
- `NOTICE` copyright year updated to 2026.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` added: matrix test across 7 feature combinations,
  bench compile check, and MSRV check — all using `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`
  so the suite tracks the current stable release rather than a pinned version.
- GitHub Actions versions updated across both workflow files:
  | Action | Version |
  |---|---|
  | `actions/checkout` | **v6** |
  | `actions/cache` | **v5** (Node.js 24, new cache service v2) |
  | `actions/configure-pages` | **v6** |
  | `actions/upload-pages-artifact` | **v5** |
  | `actions/deploy-pages` | **v5** |
  | `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` | **@stable** (was @1.85) |

---

## [0.13.0] — 2025-05-03

### Added

- **`tracing` Cargo feature** — when enabled, key cache operations emit
  structured `tracing` events:
  * `set` — `debug_span` with path, payload bytes, and encoding on completion.
  * `get` — `debug_span` with path; logs "cache hit" or "cache miss".
  * `check_status` — `debug` log with path, status, and reason
    (e.g. `ttl_expired`, `version_mismatch`).
  Zero-cost (compiled out) when the feature is disabled.
- **`CacheEngine::explain(path)`** — returns a [`Diagnosis`] struct with:
  * `status` — overall `CacheStatus`.
  * `entry_exists` / `file_exists` — booleans.
  * `ttl_remaining_secs` — `Some(0)` if expired, `None` if no TTL configured.
  * `hash_match: Option<bool>` — hash comparison result.
  * `metadata_diff: Option<MetadataDiff>` — `mtime` / `file_size` stored vs
    current, with `mtime_changed` / `size_changed` flags.
  * `payload_version: Option<PayloadVersionInfo>` — stored vs expected version,
    with `matches` flag.
  * `summary: String` — human-readable one-liner explaining the status.
- **`Diagnosis`**, **`MetadataDiff`**, **`PayloadVersionInfo`** — new public
  types exported from `localcache`.
- **`AsyncCacheEngine::explain(path)`** and **`ConnectionPool::explain(path)`**
  — async and pooled variants.
- **`QueryBuilder::order_by_last_accessed(ascending)`** — sort by
  `last_accessed_at` timestamp.  Entries never read since being written have
  `last_accessed_at == 0` and sort as "oldest" in ascending order.
- **Multi-column sort** — `order_by` is now a `Vec<OrderBy>` (was
  `Option<OrderBy>`).  Chain secondary sort keys with:
  * `then_by_field(field_path, ascending)` (requires `json` feature)
  * `then_by_updated_at(ascending)`
  * `then_by_last_accessed(ascending)`
  * `then_by_path(ascending)`
- **CLI `inspect <PATH>`** — calls `explain()` and prints a formatted report
  with status, metadata diff, TTL, hash match, and payload version info.
- **`rust-version = "1.85"`** in `Cargo.toml` — makes the MSRV explicit
  (edition 2024 requires Rust ≥ 1.85).
